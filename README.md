# SpaceXLaunches
This project is a mobile application in Java using CodeNameOne. It was a project for my school: "Create a mobile application using Java or Javascript/Html/css(PWA)". On this application, you can sort all past launches or see the next/latest launch.


If you want you can fork my repository and upgrade my application :)

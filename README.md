# SpaceXLaunches
This project is a mobile application in Java using CodeNameOne. It was a project for my school: "Create a mobile application using Java or Javascript/Html/css (PWA)". On this application, you can sort all past launches and see the next/latest launch. You can also see more informations about the launch (rocket,flight number,description, etc...). This application also has a login/register form. All informations are in my "RP"! (It's in french sorry :/)


If you want you can fork my repository and upgrade my application :)

# SpaceXLaunches
This project is a mobile application in Java using CodeNameOne. It was a school project ==> "Creating a mobile application using Java or Javascript/Html/css (PWA)". On this application, you can sort all past launches and see the next/latest launch. You can also see more informations about the launch (rocket,flight number,description, etc...). This application also has a login/register form. All informations are in my doc : "SpaceXLaunches/doc/A30 - RP - Stella.docx" (It's in french sorry :/)

I'm using a API to get all launches or for the login/register (all in doc folder).


If you want you can fork my repository and upgrade my application :)
